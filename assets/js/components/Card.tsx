      Two-handed pole weapon. It hews, it slices, it stabs, it bludgeons, itâ€™s
      got fantastic anti-armor properties, strong parries, creates large wounds,
      has enormous reach, and is still short enough that you can use it like a
      staff in close. Deals 3 damage to enemies.aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
